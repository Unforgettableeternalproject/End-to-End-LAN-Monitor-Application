# End-to-End LAN Monitor Application

"I heard Bernie is trying to do something new, like a...monitoring application?"
"Yep, pretty accurate. I guess he is trying to do things other than front-end development huh?"

"But won't this kind of behavior be illegal?"
"Nah, it's just streaming video and audio from another computer in the LAN, it'll be fine"

"Well, he's Bernie. No one knows what he's thinking."
"IKR."
